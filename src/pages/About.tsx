              <p className="lead">Paradox Script was founded with a simple mission: to empower writers to create interactive multiplayer narratives without requiring coding skills.</p>
              
              <p>Our platform bridges the gap between traditional storytelling and modern interactive experiences. We believe that the future of storytelling is interactive, collaborative, and accessible to creators of all technical backgrounds.</p>
              
              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              
              <p>Founded in 2023 by a team of writers, game designers, and developers, Paradox Script emerged from a shared frustration: creating interactive narrative games required either extensive coding knowledge or significant compromise on creative vision.</p>
              
              <p>We set out to build a platform that puts storytelling first, handling all the technical complexities behind the scenes while giving writers the tools they need to craft rich, branching narratives that players can experience together.</p>
              
              <h2>Our Vision</h2>
              
              <p>We envision a world where interactive storytelling is as accessible to create as it is to consume. Where writers can focus on crafting compelling narratives and engaging characters rather than wrestling with code.</p>
              
              <p>Paradox Script is more than just a toolâ€”it's a community of creators pushing the boundaries of what interactive storytelling can be.</p>
